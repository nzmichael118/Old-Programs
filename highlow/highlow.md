## Highlow
Perhaps one of my largest projects I worked on whilst at highschool. I made this for a year 12/13? 
it is a simple game of highlow, a deck of cards is drawn, you have to guess if the next card is going to be higher or lower.
To run: run server.py first then multiple instances of gui.py - for each player -
This program had alot of ambition set short by a deadline, reading into the roadmap file I achieved 5 of the 6 optional programming concepts recommended, to get an Excellence you need 2 of them. I went well above what was required - not to toot my own horn. many feautres I planned on adding were not implimented such as a bot that would card count and play optimally.
