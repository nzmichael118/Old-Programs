Brief:
Variations on the Higher-Lower card game have existed your many years and some have even turned into television shows where multiple players compete against each other.

Your task is to create a Multiplayer Card game that allows 3 players to compete against each other using the following rules.

•	An initial card is drawn (Ace to King).
•	An initial money bank is established. 
•	The first player chooses whether the next card will be higher or lower than the previously drawn card shown.
•	If they are correct, 
o	Money gets added to a game bank.
o	The player chooses whether to collect the banked money and pass control over to the next player or play again.

•	If they are incorrect,
o	Control passes to the next player

•	The last drawn card becomes the new compared card .
•	A player can only collect the bank if they have guessed correctly at least one on their current turn.

Extra Features
•	Each player will receive a certain number of ‘swaps’ for the game which will allow then to swap the currently shown card for a hopefully better one before they make their guess. 
•	The players should be able to choose the length of each round and the number of rounds to play. E.g. 3 round with 20 cards each. 
•	The player in control at the end of the round automatically receiving the money left in the bank. 
•	The winner of the game is the player with the most banked money at the end.


IMPORTANT: It is possible to create a solution to this brief that does not meet the expectations of the standard. For your work to qualify for this standard you will need to include at least TWO
 of the following programming concepts in your solution. 

•	programming or writing code for a graphical user interface (GUI)
•	reading from, or writing to, files or other persistent storage
•	object-oriented programming using class(es) and objects defined by the student 
•	using types defined by the student 
•	using third party or non-core API, library or framework 
•	using complex data structures (e.g. stacks, queues, trees).
