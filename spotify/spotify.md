## Spotify "auto downloader"
Listens to audio output from spotify and uses notifications to determine the start and stops of songs and saves them as an mp3 
My notification manager is Dunst, A secondary file needs to be setup which is the output file of the notifcation manager, my origional file of such a setup is lost to time.
