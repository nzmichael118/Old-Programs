# Old-Programs
Python scripts I made when I was a young teenager: circa 2018 - 2021
(This is not representative of my current abilities I have learned much more since these projects)

## Preface
I made most of these programs around the age of 14-17 years old, In that time I have made more than just these but files
get lost as computers and hard-drives are replaced. I will seperate the projects by folder as there may be many iterations
I have stored of a project and inside each folder I will write a MD file attempting to explain my hacked together way I
did things back then.
I reccomend reading the markdown files before trying to run these scripts as most of them run in specific ways and may or may not work on your machines.
